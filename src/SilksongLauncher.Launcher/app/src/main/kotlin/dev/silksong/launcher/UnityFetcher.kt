// UnityFetcher — downloads Unity's redistributables, on the device, from Unity.
//
// None of this ships in the APK. Unity's engine and toolchain are Unity's to
// distribute, so each device fetches them from Unity directly, and what
// arrives is checked against a known digest before anything uses it.
//
// This is the Kotlin counterpart of tools/ondevice-il2cpp/fetch-unity.sh: same
// URLs, same digests, same extraction. The shell script is what runs when a PC
// or a terminal is doing the work; this is what runs when the app is.
//
// Everything is streamed and nothing is stored whole. The editor archive alone
// is 4.29 GB, of which about 155 MB is wanted, and a phone should not have to
// find room for the rest -- see the range request below for how most of it is
// never even transferred.
